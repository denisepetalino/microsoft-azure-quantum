    "In the exercise, you created a random bit generator that puts a qubit into a superposition state and then measures that qubit to generate random bit value of either 0 or 1, each with 50% probability. The value of this bit is truly random, there's no way to know ahead of time what the measurement result will be. But how can you use this behavior to generate larger random numbers?\n",
