# Microsoft Quantum Computing Fundamentals

This repository contains my notes, code snippets and reflections from completing the **Microsoft Learn – Quantum Computing Fundamentals** learning path.

🔗 Official learning path:  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/

---

## Objectives

- Build a solid foundation in quantum computing concepts.
- Understand how qubits, superposition and entanglement work at a high level.
- Explore core quantum algorithms and their use cases.
- Connect quantum computing concepts to cybersecurity and cryptography.

---

## Repository Structure

- `notes/` – Module-by-module summaries, diagrams and explanations in my own words.
- `qsharp-examples/` – Small Q# or pseudo-code examples based on the learning content.
- `resources/` – Glossaries, key terms, further reading and practice questions.

---

## Progress

- [ ] Module 1 – Introduction to quantum computing
- [ ] Module 2 – Qubits, superposition and measurement
- [ ] Module 3 – Entanglement and quantum gates
- [ ] Module 4 – Quantum algorithms and applications
- [ ] Module 5 – Azure Quantum and the ecosystem (if included)
- [ ] Review and revision notes

I’ll tick these off as I complete each module and commit notes/code.

## How I Use This Repo

- After each module, I write a short summary in `notes/`.
- Where relevant, I implement a small example in `qsharp-examples/` (or pseudo-code if I’m not using Q# locally yet).
- I capture important definitions and questions in `resources/key-terms.md` and `resources/questions.md`.

This repo is mainly for:
1. **Revision**
2. **Interview prep**
3. **Demonstrating consistent learning in quantum computing**
