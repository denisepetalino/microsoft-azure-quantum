# Microsoft Quantum Computing Fundamentals

This repository contains my notes, code snippets and reflections from completing the **Microsoft Learn – Quantum Computing Fundamentals** learning path.

## Objectives

- Build a solid foundation in quantum computing concepts.
- Understand how qubits, superposition and entanglement work at a high level.
- Explore core quantum algorithms and their use cases.
- Connect quantum computing concepts to cybersecurity and cryptography.

---

## Repository Structure

- `notes/` – Summaries, diagrams and explanations.
- `qsharp-examples/` – Small Q# or pseudo-code examples based on the learning content.

---

## How I Use This Repo

- After each module, I write a short summary in `notes/`.
- Where relevant, I implement a small example in `qsharp-examples/` (or pseudo-code if I’m not using Q# locally yet).

This repo is mainly for:
1. **Revision**
2. **Interview prep**
3. **Demonstrating consistent learning in quantum computing**
